# -D
-D or --save-dev: This flag tells npm to add the installed package to the devDependencies section of your package.json file. These dependencies are typically used during development (e.g., build tools, testing libraries) but are not needed in the production environment.

devDependencies vs dependencies:

dependencies: These are the packages required to run the application in production. They are installed when you run npm install.
devDependencies: These are only needed during development (e.g., tools for testing, building, or linting the code). They are installed when you run npm install --dev or npm install in a development environment.

# Routing
    - npm i -D react-router-dom
